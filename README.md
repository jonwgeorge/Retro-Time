*Up to date information on the development of Retro Time can be found on my [website](http://www.jonwgeorge.com/retro-time/)*

Retro Time is a watchface designed for the Pebble smart-watch. It takes design influence from all those 8-bit games we loved as a kid. This code is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license.

Battery life is displayed as 4 iconic hearts, that depleat as the life of your pebble depleats. Retro Time keeps track of your bluetooth connection status and will give you a gentle reminder if you leave your phone behind.
